Over the next couple days, work through the official Rails Getting Started Guide.

Once you’ve finished, get it on github and submit a link to the repo!

You’re going to get a little in over your heads here. You’re going to write a lot of code you don’t understand. You’re going to see lots of scary files. And you’re not going to gain much understanding! That’s fine. The point of this is for you to see things. Treat this as a guided tour. Keep hands and feet inside the ride and remain seated at all times!

Tip: Take rough notes of each of the steps you are taking. You will appreciate them later on when you are not sure where to start!
